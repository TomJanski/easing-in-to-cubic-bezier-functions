### Tuts+ Course: Easing in to Cubic Bezier Functions
#### Instructor: Guy Routledge

One way to breath a bit more life and a bit more personality into animation on the web is to experiment with different settings of easing. In this coffee-break course we'll dive into the topic of easing; discussing what is is, why it's useful, how to control it and how to apply it in the context of CSS.

#### Source Files Description:

These source files are a basis from which I demonstrate a number of easing functions during the course.
